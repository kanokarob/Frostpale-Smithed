# Survival in a Frozen World
The Frostpale is a lite-total-conversion data pack that aims to dramatically alter standard survival gameplay elements, offering unique challenges and difficulty. The Overworld has been completely transformed into a frozen wasteland. The environment is hostile, resources are scarce, and mining has never been colder.

**WARNING:** Because of the volume and nature of the changes this data pack makes to vanilla Minecraft gameplay, compatibility with other data packs, especially other worldgen data packs, is not guaranteed. In particular, The Frostpale is NOT compatible with New in Town (or at least, trying to play New in Town in the Frostpale won't be very fun), but it is compatible with Dragonkind Evolved.

## Tutorial Mode
Because of the sheer number of changes made, both to blocks the player may be familiar with, progression milestones, and so on, an optional Tutorial Mode is made available when the player enters a Frostpale world for the first time. You can toggle it at any time with /trigger frozTutorial. If enabled, informational tips will appear in chat when the player encounters something that may have been changed from vanilla gameplay. If you choose to go in blind, the standard advancement tab may help provide useful clues for progression.

## The Overworld
The following changes have been made to the Overworld:
- Most biomes are covered in snow
- Oceans are generally more shallow
- Jagged mountains are more common
- Stone has been replaced with Packed Ice
- Deepslate has been replaced with Blue Ice
- The dimension consists of the following biomes:
  - **The Snowfield:** A relatively flat tundra with piles of Packed Ice and Stone on the surface, and sparse Pale Oak Trees with no leaves
  - **Chilling Woods:** A forest of Mega Pale Oak Trees in various shapes, some of which can contain Creaking Hearts
  - **Barren Forest:** A variant of the Chilling Woods, which is much more common. Most of the trees here have been chopped down, leaving only the base of the trunk
  - **Infected Forest:** A rare variant of the Chilling Woods, with a Mycelium ground and common Huge Mushrooms
  - **Hail Mountain:** A mountain biome covered in Snow Blocks, and sparse Spruce trees. It features Icicles, which replace Pointed Dripstone
  - **Glacial Runoff:** A river that is completely frozen through, with tall walls of ice above what would otherwise be the water's surface
  - **Dry Riverbed:** A river variant that has no water, and large deposits of Clay on the ground
  - **Gravelly Beach & Ice Beach:** Relatively standard Beach Biomes
  - **Ice Fields:** A Frozen Ocean biome with Kelp and Seagrass on the seafloor, and occasional small islands where uncommon tree types like Oak, Jungle, and Cherry can be found
  - **Silent Ocean:** A rare variant of the Ice Fields, the seafloor of which is covered in Sculk blocks, including Sculk Shriekers that are able to summon Wardens
  - **Hot Spring:** A relatively rare warm biome, covered in lush vegetation and rare naturally spawning Sniffer Eggs
  - **Underground Desert:** A cave biome featuring Sand floors and Sandstone ceilings, with Cacti, Dead Bushes, and Glow Berries. This is the only place in the Frostpale to get Sand
  - **Coral Caves:** A cave biome featuring floors and ceilings of Prismarine, with lots of water, coral, and sea lanterns. Tropical Fish spawn here
- Ores in the Overworld have been greatly repositioned. Some notable changes include:
  - Coal Ore is still fairly common high up in the world, but in much smaller veins. It also now spawns much lower in the world, in somewhat larger veins
  - Iron Ore now spawns more frequently and in much larger veins
  - Diamond Ore can spawn very high up in the world, but is rarely exposed
  - Copper Ore spawns in somewhat smaller veins
- Many passive mobs, including Cows, Pigs, Chickens, and Sheep do not spawn naturally in the world
  - Wolves, Foxes, and Polar Bears now have chances to drop Leather
  - Goats now drop Mutton, and have a chance to drop a single White Wool
- Various Illager types now spawn naturally in many biomes
- Wheat Seeds no longer drop from Short/Tall Grass or Ferns. You'll need to find them in Frost Villages
- Bedrock has been replaced with Black Ice. It still cannot be mined, and Black Ice obtained from loot tables cannot be placed

- Buried Treasure
- Mineshafts
- Cold Ocean Ruins

## Recipes
- Packed Ice and Blue Ice can be collected when mined with any Pickaxe, without Silk Touch

- You can bake Logs into Charcoal using a Campfire
- Lava Buckets can be smelted from regular Buckets. They require 2 full Coal to smelt through
